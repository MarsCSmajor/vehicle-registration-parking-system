As a user, I want to login and see my own registry system

Bug in login system


 using .ignore() in file system because when it reads in files, the first char is not being read'
 this fixes the Bug

 .clear() clearing the output buffer
 also prevents missing char while using getline()


 loginData is not being stored properly bug in importloginData
