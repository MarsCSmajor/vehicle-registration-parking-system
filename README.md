# Car Registration Parking system
A program fully coded on C++ by MarsCSmajor
Compability: Only for Windows 8, 10, 11

The program creates a parking system of vehicles. Takes in VIN number, license plates, vehicle type, and name of the owner. 
You can add, search,find, and remove vehicle.

The program has a save system in which will save the changes that a user made during the program. I have build a login system that makes the user create an account in order to login to the program. All data being moved throughout the program is being moved to files. 

New Features will be added in the future and improvements will me made.
